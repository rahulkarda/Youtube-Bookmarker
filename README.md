[Manifest V3](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/mv3-overview/) is the latest set of changes to the Chrome browser's rules for browser extensions.

## Optimizations
While improving this project, I would start by implementing the following features -

    1. Adding a list of all the bookmarks on different videos
    2. Adding a title to the bookmarks
    3. Publishing the extension on the Chrome Web Store

## Lessons Learned
I learned how to create a Chrome browser extension using JavaScript and the new version of the web extensions platform, called Manifest V3. I learned about Manifest V3 which is the latest set of changes to the Chrome browserâ€™s rules for browser extensions which focuses on the three pillars of vision: privacy, security, and performance, while preserving and improving our foundation of capability and webbiness.
